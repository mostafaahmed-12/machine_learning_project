All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We\u2019re avid Catan players ourselves. We\u2019ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program.

You as a warlord of Roman and need to protect, upgrade and create a war strategy to put a stand against the marching Greece enemies. Story revolves around one of the fantasy history about these titan quest, evolution and fight.\n\nThey have game like Olympic style games in Greece, while Gladiatorial games were played in Rome. Every citizens most enjoyable time is when these games are running like a festival season.\n\nCreate a Roman type strategy.\nDefend your Roman area and people from marching enemies.\nPlan to take a strong stand against attack from Air, Land and Water.\nUpgrade your war machinery regularly.\nPower from Gods like thunder to fight against titans and warlords.\nUse coins to purchase more weapons and upgrades.\n\nAncient civilization had unique culture, gods, war type, society, treating women, slaves and art styles.\n\nThe ancient Roman and Greek civilizations had well-organized political processes that greatly influenced the manner in which later governments were structured in Europe and the United States. The system of political parties, the establishment of divisions in government -- even political words such as democracy, monarchy and tyranny originated in ancient Rome and Greece. Although Rome drew many of its political principles from the Greeks, and as a result, developed a government similar to that of Greece, there were several differences between the two.\n\nGreeks built roads to connect two specific cities. Romans built roads that connected their empire to Rome. This is the location of this addictive game.\n\nSome of the popular Greek God Vs Roman Gods names\nZeus : Jupiter\nPoseidon : Neptune\nDionysus: Bacchus\nHades : Dis Pater, Pluto, Orcus\nAres : Mars\nHermes : Mercury\nEros : Cupid (Amor)\n\nBoth are Mediterranean countries, similar enough latitudinal for both to grow wine and olives, but with very different terrain. The ancient Greek city-states were separated from each other by hilly countryside and all were near the water. on the other hand Rome was inland, on one side of the Tiber River, but the Italic tribes (in the boot-shaped peninsula that is now Italy) did not have the natural hilly borders to keep them out.\n\nIn Ancient Greece women had no rights.  They were property. While in Rome, under the king and in the republic, women were not property, still they had no equal rights.  During the Empire, Roman women had quite a few rights, but were still not citizens.\n\nThe armies of Republican Rome were strongly rooted in the Italian peasantry.  Rome's political reach was broader than comparable Greek states and military service obligations extended farther down the social scale. This made for a large army with a lot of rural soldiers: people who were used to the outdoor life, familiar with manual labor, and self sufficient.\n\nGreek city state armies tended to be more upper class affairs: the extreme example being Sparta, where the entire army was drawn from the privileged class of Spartiates; but even at Athens there was a lot of tension between the relatively well off hoplite class of landowners and prosperous city folk and the thetes - the urban  working class who could not afford their own armor and were relegated to the rowing benches of the navy. (Note the the Macedonians during their heyday had a much broader base among rural peasants, more on the Roman model).\n\nOver time both Greek and Roman armies professionalized, but in different ways.  After the classical period many Greek armies relied heavily on mercenaries, which provided some impressive technical skills and specialties, but also political unreliability.  Roman armies became more professional as the Italian peasantry was displaced in the late Republic by huge slave-run plantations: the military revolutions of generals like Caesar and Pompey were made easier as soldiering became a lifelong career instead of a short-service civic duty.""",Wahid Zhowandai,4+,EN,94702592,Games,"Games, Strategy, Action",13/03/2016,21/05/2018,4.0

With dynamically generated levels and simple but joyful touch user interface. It is playable by the youngest of RPG fans and supports Mfi Bluetooth game controllers.\n\n\nYou play as Focus, the avatar and point of view.\n\nYour role is to find your inner peace by achieving total and unfettered understanding of the Objective Reality, who, - according to some, is the ever-changing three-state object.\n\nYou have to learn much in order to defeat Fear, who is related to Danger in the same way as Pain is related to Damage, and who is one of the many obstacles in the game of Life.\n\nYour Focus will automagically grow stronger as it gains Memory, but you can learn to affect what you spend your Memory on. Memory is gained by interacting with the game world.\n\nPress and hold on your Focus to check its elements and affect them.\n\nWhen your Love for Life drops to zero, your Focus will reincarnate as the next generation. The game reality will reset and you will be back at the beginning, with your Memories as before reincarnation, but the world will be much different now. Your accumulated Wealth will help you in early start if you transform it to Will.\n\n\nHealth is linked to your Love of Life.\n\nLight (Speed) and Force are linked to your Memory gain ability.\n\nWill will let you cast Teleport when you reincarnate. Will can be purchased with Wealth but it cannot be sold.

It's quite satisfying, though.\u201c \nJennifer Allen, 148Apps, 4/5 stars\n\n\u201eHow many acronyms can you cram into a single game? Crowntakers is a PDL TBS RPG (that is, a procedural death labyrinth role-playing game with turn-based strategy combat) (\u2026) and it\u2019s really good fun if you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics.\u201c\nMichelle Star, CNET\n\n\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\nUser Ratings\n\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\n\n5/5 - If you like turn based tactical medieval rpg's get this. Not as much story/length as final fantasy tactics, but frankly on iDevices I consider that a win. Bite sized battles, winnable in a day on easy, challenging on hard, good replay value. Only crashed once on 1st gen mini\n\n5/5 - This is worth your money. You get a polished game, tactical battles, and thoughtful choices in exploration. Also big points for splitting the game into two difficulties. One being sort of roguelike with permadeath and the other much more RPG without permadeath and with consistent leveling. If you're thinking about this one, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy it like I do!\n\n5/5 - This game should get much more hype. I've been playing it non-stop in my free time for over a week. Despite some bugs (which the dev's have been very quick to address), Each game feels quite different with the random locations within areas, random loot and different party builds. It's not easy at first, but learning different strategies as you go is enjoyable. Highly recommend this game!\n\n5/5 - Big fan of this game. The battles are very tactical and the map navigation is really streamlined and fun to explore. This is a good one for any rogue-like fans. It's not super punishing, but it does present a nice challenge on the normal mode (haven't beaten it yet, but I hope a hard mode unlocks after doing so).""",Kalypso Media Group GmbH,12+,"EN, FR, DE, IT, JA, KO, RU, ZH, ES, ZH",693882880,Games,"Games, Role Playing, Strategy",31/03/2015,3/4/2017,4.5

Here is your chance to find out\u2026\n\nAn entire virtual country\n\nDemocracy 3 simulates the motivations, loyalties and desires of everyone in the country. A custom-designed neural network is used to model individual voters, each which varying memberships of voting groups, political parties and pressure groups. Each voters income is modelled, along with their levels of complacency and cynicism. This is the most sophisticated political strategy game ever created.\n\nUnique user interface\n\nDespite being vastly detailed under-the-hood, Democracy 3 has a unique user interface that makes visualising the connections between laws, policies, voters and situations easy. A simple iconic-based view of your countries issues allows you to 'drill-down' through all the relationships between policies and voters to quickly analyse the impacts of your decisions. Your trade policy may affect GDP, which will affect unemployment, which will effect poverty, and thus crime, leading to a change in tourism, which affects GDP\u2026\n\nComplex simulated voters\n\nEach individual voter is a mixture of a subset of the 21 different voter groups represented within the game. They might be a young, wealthy, liberal socialist commuter, or a retired conservative religious capitalist, for example. Not only this, but the extent to which they identify each of those groups is both variable, and can be affected by your policies in the long term. Convert your country to religion, or atheism, to capitalism, or socialism by careful and nuanced adjustment of your policies and laws over time. A 'focus group' feature lets you look at individual voters and see exactly how they came to a decision to vote for you (or not!).\n\nDetailed policy model\n\nEach policy (or law) in the game has a slider which allows you to fine tune it's intensity to get the balance just right. A series of equations within the game allows the same policy to have radically different effects on each voter group at different points in the slider, so some voters may be indifferent to a policy unless it reaches extreme levels, for example. Democracy 3 also models the global economy, including credit rating agencies and debt interest levels, as well as the impact of global events on your country.""",Positech Games,12+,EN,122864640,Games,"Games, Strategy, Simulation",8/6/2014,2/2/2016,3.5

Each player tries to win a fight for the nest by surrounding a small defenseless chick with their various bird soldiers - while trying to protect their own.\n\nHow to win?\n\nVictory can only be achieved in one way. You have to surround the enemy\u2019s chicken from all six sides of these hexagons.

You can either cast a new stone or move with already deployed one.\no. The first stone of the starting player belongs to the centre of the battlefield. The first stone of the second player must be placed on the touch of the opponent's first stone.\no. Each newly deployed stone (except the first stone) must only be attached to one's own existing stones and must not touch any opposing ones.\no. Until you deploy the chick (in the third or fourth move), players are only allowed to cast stones, not to move with them. From then on, you can move your stone in one of the ways described below, at your discretion to win the game!\no. All stones must be connected to each other with at least one side, therefore creating a nest.

Control mighty battle ship turrets and try to defeat the other captian. You have to sink the oponens battleship by bombing it with rockets and missiles. Both players play on the same device against each other. If there is just one player this player could play against a computer controlled enemy.\n\nGameplay and controls:\nOn a playround two oponens face each others battleships. Each battleship has four turrets. At the beginning these canons are normal canons, but can be specialized and upgraded during the game. The turrets swing on a 90 degrees angle by themselves. The player can fire a canon by touching it. A fired canon needs to cool down for three seconds (greyed out). To hit the enemys battleship the player has to time the touching to lunch missiles to the right direction. Rockets can be catched and stopped by other rockets. If two rockets collide that player gets some gamecash the side the collision happened on. Players can buy turret upgrades from this gamecash every 60seconds (end of playround) on a special upgrade menu. If a player brings the lifebar of the enemy to zero the battleship explodes and the player wins.\n\nUpgrades:\nEach normal canon can be upgraded to one of four special turret systems. Once chosen these upgrades can't be removed or downgraded. Specialized canons can be upgraded two times to a higher level within their kind.\n\nHEAT: The heat canon is a pure defence weapon that can't damage the enemys battleship. Instead of rockets this turret sends out a special heat wave that can destroy multiple missiles.\n\nMINI: The mini-gun canon lunches normal rockets but has a lowered cool down time. This makes it possible to cause a real rainshower of bombs on the highest upgrade level.\n\nSTUN: The stun canon fires eletric bolts instead of missiles. These can't damage the enemys battleship but can disable enemy turrets for a while instead.\n\nCLUST: The cluster canon lunches special rockets that split up on their way to multiple normal missiles and causing therefor a lot of damage.\n\nTORPEDO: The torpedo canon fires torpedos that go under water. They can't be stopped or bounced. \n\nBOUNCE: The bounce canon fires a shockwave that bounces back all normal missiles.\n\n--\nMade in Berlin, Germany""",Marco Kehler,9+,EN,17678336,Games,"Games, Action, Strategy, Entertainment",6/9/2014,9/4/2015,4.5

Use the Undo button (top right of screen) to undo last move if you make a mistake.\n3. Turn screen sideways to make view wider when you have a lot of cards in your hand.\n\nBasic Rules:\n\nEach player is dealt 3 \'face down cards\'. You are not allowed to see or change these until the end of the game. Next, 3 \'face up cards\' are placed on top. Finally, each player is dealt 3 cards to form their hand. If you wish, you can switch cards from your \'hand\' with your \'face up cards\'."";\n\nWhoever has a 3 or the next lowest card starts the game.\n\nEach turn you must discard a card (or two or more cards of the same) greater than or equal to the one at the top of the pick up pile, then draw cards from the deck so you have at least 3 cards in your hand (unless the deck has run out of cards or you already have 3 or more cards in you hand).\n\n2\'s and 10\'s are wild cards. 2\'s resets the pile and 10\'s clear the pile. 4 of a kind, like a 10, clears the pile.\n\nIf don\'t have a card that is greater than or equal to the card on top of the pile or a wild card, you must pick up the entire pile.\n\nWhen there are no more cards in your hand, and the deck is empty, proceed to play your face up cards.

Once designed for high-pressure environments and exploring gas giants and deep space, these mechs have now been modified for war. \n\nTemplars descend from a Zendu bloodline -- a unique heritage that gives them the ability (with proper training and ritual) to pass all of memories from their lives (and any memories passed down by their ancestors) to a newborn child. This memory gift is known as a Templar\u2019s Lineage \u2013 and it is what gives Templars their immense advantage in combat, tactics, engineering, and the ability to drive hulking Leviathan Battle Suits. You will take on the role of a Templar Captain who hails from a storied Lineage reaching back 87 Templars -- and who pages back through the memories to help cope with the dire situation at hand.\n\nWith the Great Exodus coming to an end, the Star Traders founded new colonies on the few remaining habitable worlds. The Templar Knights are called upon once again to defend the Star Traders and their new colonies from an ancient threat.\n\n= WHO WE ARE = \nTrese Brothers Games is a premier indie game developer of desktop and mobile RPG and strategy games.

I have played SHG games for years. Best one yet ... awesome job guys!! \n\n-Wicked Space Game If you like SyFy then you should enjoy this game.\n\n-Addictive and full of hidden depths This is a simple game. Or so it seems at first, the gameplay is remarkably easy to get your fingers around (playing on a phone, that\'s an important feature). But what becomes addictive is not the simple play, but the depth of story that has been crafted.\n\n-Fun Stuff!! What an adventurous involving time I had playing Zombie Moon. Love the sounds and customizing my marine to do in the zombies. \n\nReview from one of the Game Creators\nAs one of the game creators, and player too, I love Zombie Moon and glad others are as well!  It\'s the mobile evolution of the existing www.starpirates.net, www.spybattle.com & www.gatesofcamelot.com.  It\'s actually in the same universe at, roughly, the same time.  The gameplay is streamlined as the mobile experience (and screensize!) leads to a different style of play.  For me, it works. \n\nI love the storyline that comes out through the Missions feature.  There is a mystery involved, and that unrolls through the Missions.  \n\nThe game is free; you really don\'t have to pay to play, nor give Snakehead private info, to continue.\n\nI love being part of an awesome Snakehead Games community that loves our games.  \n \n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFor news and updates follow us on social media:\n\nZombie Moon Twitter  https://twitter.com/zombiemoongame\n\nZombie Moon Facebook https://www.facebook.com/ZombieMoonMobile\n\n\nMORE REVIEWS\n\n- FANTASTIC -- This is the very first game I have played on my phone. Now I understand what my kids are saying. Its a lot of fun.\n\n- DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!! Awesome game.\n\n- MAFIAWARS MOVE OVER  -- I used to play Mafia Wars when it first came out. You know when Facebook was a wee lad. Anyway, it went from fun to demanding I pester everyone I know on facebook to advance. Ugh. Zombiemoon seems to have figured out the right balance. It\u2019s like the son of Mafia Wars, in space, fighting zombies. Me like!\n\n- Great game full of intrigue and mystery.\n\n-Phenomenal Story and Graphics -- Out of all of the social media / Browser Games I\'ve played, this one has the best graphics and sound I have seen.

The last bastion of hope for Earth, E-CON operates out of vast militarised caverns and tries it's utmost to find a way to wrestle control of Earth back from the Insectron invaders.\n\n** Aliens: Insectron **\nThe basis for all Insectron 'life' are two substances believed to be based on highly advanced nanomachines.  The first substance, labelled 'Xenoaqua', is a quicksilver like substance which hardens to create Insectron structures and armour.  It is highly adaptable and will self-repair by absorbing more liquid Xenoaqua.  The second substance is 'Xenophy', a purple liquid, said to have the consistency of thick syrup.  Xenophy is thought to be the 'brains' inside the Insectron machines and the most vulnerable to damage.  It is unknown if the Insectron think with a' hivemind' or if they feel individuality, but both there is evidence to support both claims.  The Insectrons follow a pack mentality to the point they seem to share their perceptions on the battlefield almost instantaneously, they also display fear and self-survival when in danger.\n\n** Martians: The Holy Gravidus Republic (HGR) **\nHumans first settled on Mars midway into the 22nd century. Isolated for hundreds of years, the Colony on Mars grew into a religious order. While Earth burned for decades, the Insectron horde sent a much smaller force to occupy Mars; and while the Martians and Insectrons clashed, the Martian people were left relatively unhindered in their progress. Waiting for the perfect moment, the HTR have unleashed the full potential of their technology, wiping aside the Insectron occupation force. They now have their eyes set upon Earth, to reap revenge.\n\nFind us on Facebook \u2013 facebook.com/HexWar\nFollow us on Twitter - @HexWarGames \nGame Forum - hexwar.com/forums \n\nThank you for supporting our games! \n\n\xa9 2016 HexWar Games Ltd.\nAll Rights Reserved.""",HexWar Games Ltd,12+,EN,519126016,Games,"Games, Simulation, Strategy",7/1/2016,25/03/2016,3.5

In this space-based city building game you must design, build and manage a self-sustaining civilization on a remote and desolate planet.\n\nDESIGN AND BUILD A SPACE CITY\nTo build a successful city you will need to attract residents to the planet by building accommodation for them to live in.  They will need somewhere to work so you will also develop commerce and businesses to provide them with employment.   \n\nUnlike Earth, there isn\u2019t a ready supply of resources so you will be responsible for providing power, water and oxygen for your citizens, farming for food and mining for resources.\n\nIt is not all about work though as that will make your population unhappy.  Provide them with city services, leisure and community buildings, parks and decorations to keep your new residents happy and content in their new city.\n\nHappy people will work harder and create more income for you to spend building and improving your city.  Manage transport networks to keep your citizens moving and build spaceports to increase industry and travel.\n\nMANAGE YOUR CITY\nSuitable for all ages and all experience levels, Space City can be played as a regular city builder and you\u2019re completely free to design a fabulous city or you can use the inbuilt advanced analytics to optimize your city - down to an individual building level.\n\nThe more advanced city builders can apply town zoning principles, manage pollution levels, efficiently deploy city services and optimize resources to increase city happiness and maximize city revenue.  Keep it as simple as you like or be a tycoon and micromanage building your city and keeping your people happy; the choice is yours.\n\nDESIGN AND EVOLVE YOUR CITY\nDynamic land generation ensures no two civilizations will ever look the same.  Want to create a commercial powerhouse?  No problem, zone a commercial area and build high tech businesses.  Want to be a tycoon?  No problem, zone a large industrial area and sell the mined resources on the global exchange.\n\nWith non-scripted game play you have the creative freedom to build your city your way.  The only limitation is your imagination.\n\nIf you love space city building games then this is the space building game for you.

We have all taken different paths leading towards our final death in Armageddon.\nAnd so like every old story, here begins the conflict for the sarcophagus, rumored to contain the body of the Third Mortal Ancestor who according to legend was the first vampire.

Now, the real question remains:  How will you lead us to finish this chaos and bring us back to the dominance we once held?\n\nFEATURES:\n- Massive Multiplayer ONLINE Gameplay for iPhone and iPod Touch!\n- Gorgeous graphics and exciting battle animations!\n- FREE updates with new missions, skills, slaves, and more!\n- Strengthen your tribe and collect powerful heroes with different skills!\n- Fight and recruit legendary heroes to fight for you!\n- Team battle system enables you to join epic wars!\n- Bring your friends into your hive to make it stronger!\n- Perform numerous dark missions\n- Loot rare items and skills\n- Get real time updates\n- Experience real-time chat\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n- This is an online game only. iPod Touch users must be connected to WiFi in order to play.",iFree Studio Limited,4+,"EN, FR, DE, JA, KO, PT, RU, ZH, ES, ZH",31711232,Games,"Games, Role Playing, Strategy",21/12/2011,15/07/2014,3.0

The American colonies are outraged over new taxes imposed upon them by Great Britain. They begin to stockpile arms and organize militia. On April 18th, militia members ambush a column of 700 British Redcoats ordered to seize stockpiled arms. 273 British soldiers are killed or wounded before they reach safety in Boston. \n\nThe American Revolution has begun! \n\nNow you and your friends command the armies of the British Redcoats, English Loyalists, German Hessians, American Regulars, Patriots, French Regulars and Native Americans to decide the fate of the Americas.

Experience this critical time in American history, you will not be disappointed! \n\n- 3 Scenarios \u2013 1775, 1775 (Short) and Siege of Quebec. \n- Play solo vs. 3 AI difficulties \n- 54 Cards (Movement & Event) \n- Cross-platform online play or up to 4 player hotseat multiplayer. \n- Faithful conversion of the original board game.\n\nAbout the Game \n\n1775: Rebellion is based on the award winning board game developed by Academy Games. \n\nThe mapboard represents the original 13 Colonies plus Maine, Nova Scotia, and Quebec. Each Colony is further subdivided into areas over which factions will struggle for control. A faction holds control of a Colony when only units of its side are present in the areas of a Colony. Player controlled factions include the Continental Army, Patriot Militia, British Regulars and Loyalist Militia. In addition to this the Allied French and Allied Hessian factions, which are controlled by American and British forces respectively, can be brought into the game by event cards playable by each faction. \n\nEach game is played in a series of rounds. Victory conditions are checked for each side starting on round three and each game ends with victory points being tallied automatically on round eight if no one has won before then. Each round is subdivided into four turns, one for each side, which happen in order determined by a blind draw of the turn marker for each faction. It is entirely possible for a faction to go last in a previous round only to go first in the next. \n\nMovement & Events \n\nEvery Faction has a deck of cards consisting of Event cards, Movement cards, and one Truce card. Every turn, each faction will play a movement card to maneuver their troops and any number of event cards. When both factions of a side (British or American) have played their truce cards, the game will end! Each deck has a specific number of movement cards in it and managing them is an important part of the game. \n\nEach faction has a Truce card which serves not only as a timer for the game but as a powerful Movement card. However, a game may end prematurely if both factions of a side are forced to play it early in the game.\n\nNote: We recommend playing on an iPhone 5S, iPad Mini 2, iPad Air, iPad Pro or newer device.",HexWar Games Ltd,12+,EN,323195904,Games,"Games, Strategy, Board",3/11/2016,1/8/2017,4.0

All plays are movie names, and movies are connected by actors. You play a movie connected to mine, then I play one connected to yours. Opponents fire movies back and forth getting points for each play. It may take seven or more connected movies to reach 100 points and win the game.\n\nFireback Movies is simple to understand but challenging and entertaining. Traditional trivia games ask random lists of trivia questions. In Fireback Movies, each player dynamically creates the challenge posed to the opponent on each turn. For example, if your opponent plays Boogie Nights, you could fire back Almost Famous (connected by Philip Seymour Hoffman.) There are limitless possibilities of finding one degree connections between movies using any actor.\n\nFireback Movies is a casual game where players can take their turns when they want. Fireback Movies checks your connections by referencing its proprietary database of 250,000 movies. It knows when there is more than one connection even when you do not. When players take their turns, the app gives immediate feedback to support the option for rapid-fire play. The actors who connect movies are shown after each play.\n\nUnlike most trivia games, Fireback Movies lets you show your personality. In Fireback Movies, players play movies they are familiar with. As opponents reveal their movie knowledge, you learn about them. A game against one friend is a different experience from one against another.\n\nPlays in Fireback Movies are strategic. Some connected movies score more points than others. If you can play a movie with different actor connections from the last play, it is called a Change Connection and gets the most bonus points. Bonus points are also awarded for multiple actor connections and fast play.\n\nWhen players are stumped in Fireback Movies, they can use lifelines or pass. Lifelines are popular movies connected by popular actors that keep the game fun for both players. Fireback Movies is a freemium full-featured game with no limitations requiring purchases or advantages for people to ""pay to win.""\n\nOne Degree Games created Fireback Movies to give movie fans a new way to connect with each other by connecting movies!\n\nFollow us on: \ntwitter - https://twitter.com/firebackmovies\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/firebackmovies\npinterest - https://www.pinterest.com/firebackmovies",One Degree Games,4+,"AF, CA, HR, CS, DA, NL, EN, FI, FR, DE, EL, HU, ID, IT, JA, KO, LT, MS, NB, PL, PT, RO, RU, ZH, SK, ES, SV, TH, ZH, TR, UK, VI",45889536,Games,"Games, Trivia, Strategy",25/07/2014,12/2/2019,4.5

To make predictions, the brain must have an \u201cinternal model\u201d of the system it interacts with. A basic form of this function is at play when we move our body. For example, to reach for a cup, the brain must have a model to predict how the hand would respond to various motor commands. Internal models are also thought to play a crucial role when we mentally predict future states of the environment, for example when we track a ball as it moves behind another object. Here, we have designed a simple task to understand how the nervous system makes such predictions. In this task, subjects have to intercept a ball when it reaches its final position. By changing the speed of the ball, the intervals when it is invisible, and the target position, we will test various hypotheses about the algorithms that are used to integrate information about past and present to make predictions about future.",CW&T,4+,EN,3293184,Games,"Games, Health & Fitness, Strategy",4/5/2015,13/05/2015,4.5

Remember what you have learnt about surviving a zombie disaster and guide your people in this post-apocalyptic adventure.\n\nThe world as we know it no longer exists; now it is time to create a new one. It won\u2019t be easy! The zombies are a true plague. They\u2019re not very smart, but they\u2019re everywhere, and they are legion.\n\nBuild your own shelter and make it safe. Find survivors and convince them to join you. Together you will be able to improve the shelter and create a new home. Those will be the first steps towards building a new civilization, a new zombie-free world for humans.\n\nBut the road to survival is filled with danger. There are no governments, no authorities: anarchy reigns over the world. Survival not only depends on staying away from the zombies, you must also defend your shelter from bandits and thieves. Other survivors have built shelters too, and they see you as a threat. In this post-apocalyptic world, every new settlement that is discovered is considered a threat and treated like a dangerous enemy. Trust is no longer the order of the day \u2013 it is an exception.\n\nDEFEAT THE PLAGUE\nLead your squad against the zombie hordes and defeat the undead. Attack their gathering points and collect resources to help your people. Victory in the war against the undead lies in your hands.\n\n\nFIGHT FOR SURVIVAL\nAttack other settlements to survive. Study their defenses, prepare your team, and develop the right strategy to get inside other shelters to steal their resources.\n\nDEFEND WHAT IS YOURS\nTrain your team to defend your base and configure a defensive system to protect it from the zombies. But do not underestimate survivors! Humans from other settlements will try to plunder your shelter.\n\nRECRUIT SURVIVORS\nFind isolated people, and together build a safe place to live, far from zombies and bandits. Assign them roles in the shelter and ask for their help while you leave to collect resources. Turn survivors into heroes in the war against zombies.\n\nNEGOTIATE WITH OTHER SETTLEMENTS\nEveryone is an enemy, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way forever. Contact other refugees and create alliances with them. Building a new world is a tough proposition: you\u2019ll need to negotiate with other shelters to succeed.\n\nBUILD THE BEST SHELTER\nThe world has come to an end, but that doesn\u2019t mean survivors should live badly. Manage your shelter, improve it to make space for more survivors, add entertainment zones and farming areas. Grow crops, recycle materials, and establish a self-sufficient community.\n\nTAKE THE SURVIVORS INTO THE REAL WORLD\n\nUse the Augmented Reality feature to bring the survivors into the real world. See how they look in the street or in your home, and take a photo with them.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Build your shelter from scratch and defend it from zombies and other survivors\n- Attack other shelters to get more resources\n- Player Vs. Player modes\n- Recruit survivors and create a powerful anti-zombie squad\n- Chat with other players\n- All game modes can be played for free\n- Sign in to your Game Center account to save your progress\n- Optimized for iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone \n- The Augmented Reality feature is exclusive for iOS devices.
